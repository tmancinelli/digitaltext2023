            </h1>
               <p>
               <sup>It was on a dreary</sup> night of November<br>
               that I beheld <s><s>the frame on whic</s></s> my man comple<s>at</s><s>te</s>ed<s>.</s><s>,</s> <s>And</s><br>
               with an anxiety that almost amount<br>
               ed to agony I collected instruments of life<br>
               around me <s>and endeavour to</s> <s>that I might</s> <s>e</s><s>i</s>nfuse a<br>
               spark of being into the lifeless thin<s>k</s><s>g</s><br>
               that lay at my feet. It was already<br>
               one in the morning, <s>the rain</s> pattered<br>
               dismally against the window panes, &amp;<br>
               my candle was nearly burnt out, when<br>
               by the glimmer of the half extinguish<br>
               ed light I saw the dull yellow eye of<br>
               the creature open<s>.</s><s>â€”</s>It breathed hard,<br>
               and a convulsive motion agitated<br>
               its limbs.
            </p>
               <p>
               <s>But how</s> How can I describe my<br>
               emotion at this catastrophe; or how deli<br>
               neate the wretch whom with such<br>
               infinite pains and care I had endeavoured<br>
               to form. His limbs were in proportion<br>
               and I had selected his features <s>h</s> as<br>
               <s>handsome</s> <s><span style="left:-5em; position: absolute; font-size: 0.6em;">handsome</span></s> <s>beautiful</s>. <s><s>Handsome</s></s>; Great God! His<br>
               <s>dun</s> <span style="left:-5em; position: absolute; font-size: 0.6em;">yellow</span> skin scarcely covered the work of<br>
               muscles and arteries beneath; his hair<br>
               was <span style="left:-5em; position: absolute; font-size: 0.6em;">of a lustrous black &amp;</span> flowing and his teeth of a pearly white<br>
               ness but these luxurianc<s>i</s>es only <s>fomed</s><br>
               formed a more horrid contrast with
               his watry eyes that seemed almost of
               the same colour as the dun white
               sockets in which they were set,
